# Shell_Implementation
This project was my 1st Homework for the course CMPE 322 (Operating Systems) at Bogazici University.

## About the Project
In this project I implemented my own shell for an operating system. The requirements of the shell (stated as MUSTS, SHOULDS, and CANS) can be found in the project description. The shell works with linux shell commands as well as project specific commands which are explicitly stated in the project description.

## To Run the Code
First, make sure the Makefile and the myshell.c are in the same directory. Then create the executable with the Makefile:

```make```

Now, you can run the executable with:

```./myshell```

## Final Remarks
The implementation approach for the shell can be found in the project report. Also, the C code has explanatory comments for the convenience.
